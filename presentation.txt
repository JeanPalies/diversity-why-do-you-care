		<span class="fragment fade-out">I chose to study computer science a bit by accident. </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I was in high school, I discovered HTML and Javascript (it was in 2000, when everyone was discovering how to create web pages).</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I liked the way we could build new things and decided to pursue my studies in computer science.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I arrived at the University, I saw that computer science was maybe not really so attractive to young women.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">We were only 10 girls for 90 boys (and I was told it was a really good year !). </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I don't remember my classmates beeing sexist or so, </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">but I clearly remember some of my teachers not talking to girls or making it clear we didn't belong here.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, maybe because I'm stubborn, I decided to stay.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">In 2nd year, their were even fewer girls... </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">After these 2 years, I had understood that programming was not a girls' thing.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">So I decided to pursue my studies to become a project manager ! </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I arrived at my engineering school, where once again, there were only 10% of women... </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">This time, maybe because I was prepared and used to it, but I can't remember any discrimination between boys and girls.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">But still, I heard people around me say things like "You chose to study computer science only to find a good husband".</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">(By the way, do you ask nurse or a teacher if they chose this job to find a wife ?)</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">As an aside : It's exactly the same with video games.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">If you are a women playing video games online, you're always accused of flirting.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">You are playing just to find a boyfriend, not because maybe you can find it fun...</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">And honestly, it's not only my lack of time that has made me stop playing online video games...</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I'm just fed up with having to justify myself all the time for something I do (I did) because I enjoyed it.</span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">But there were always a little voice in my head saying "You are just here to enhance the statistics, not because you earned it". </span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">Welcome, Impostor Syndrom !</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">After graduating, I started to work in a big computer science company.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out"> I was told that because I was junior, I had to start as a developer, and could become project manager after a few years.</span>

	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">So I programmed, learned new frameworks, new languages, had fun learning new things... (and enjoyed it)</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">But every time I was presented to clients, I was told to wear a dress or a skirt.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Did the client only choose me because of my legs or was it because I had the required technical competences ? </span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Was it only to "feminize" the work place ? People told me it was an asset to be a woman, but I saw this as a burden.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">I was just seen as THE woman of the team, like a green plant or a trophee you set in the middle of the office for everyone to see.</span>

A diverse group of problem-solvers usually has a better chance of outperforming a less diverse team, thanks to the broader range of experiences each member brings to the table.

== Recruitment
- Take care of your job description !
* Free pizza / bier / table tennis, ...
* vs. Remote work, time to take care of your beloved ones, equity in treatment, respect, ...

== Recruitment
Change your process ?

- Anonymous resume 
- Technical recruitment tests 
- ...

== At work
- Sponsorship
- Religious holidays


[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Provide sponsorship. Show that you care and accept everyone.
- Some people might need days off for religious purpose. Take this into consideration in your schedules. 
--

== At work
- Tasks distribution 
- Work hours
- Clothes



[NOTE.speaker]

- Front end for girls / Back end for boys ?
- Take care of your meeting times. Some people have to take care of beloved ones / significant others and can't stay late, some have buses to catch, some can't work efficiently in the morning... You are working with human being, try to adapt ! Maybe just ask what the best time would be and timebox the meetings
- There is also a big problem whith clothes, especially in summer. Why can't we see men's legs at work while women can wear really short skirts ? Were it the same if women didn't shave their legs ? I have never been given a real answer to this question... Nonetheless, equality is in both directions.

== Day to day live
- Speaking 
- Listening
- Chores distribution (at home *_and_* at work)

[NOTE.speaker]

"Violence symbolique"
- Be careful about the way you speak. Not everyone has the same knowledge. When citing someone, just take time to make sure everyone knows the reference or explain it. When talking about a framework, make sure everyone knows it or again, take time to explain. It's during such conversations that people can feel that they are set aside and do not belong here.
It is the same with humor. Not everyone has the same sense of humor and some jokes might be offensive to certain people. Don't be afraid to say "I'm sorry" if you hurt someone.
Also, mind your swear words. If you are like me when you are coding, swear words are easilly said. Try not to use sexualized swear words like in french "Putain" (I know, it is not easy !). Some expression can be offensive towards people even when it is not meant to be.
- while speaking is important, listening is even more important ! Try to listen to people and let them speak, particuly in meetings. Make sure every one had the same opportunity to express their opinion, men as women, juniors as seniors.

== Day to day live

- Chores distribution (at home *_and_* at work)

[NOTE.speaker]

I also wanted to add something about chores distribution. Cooking, cleaning, child care, ... Men also do all these things. So just let them time to take care of their children, to be at home. Allowing remote work can also be a great solution !

It's the day to day concerns that will drive peolpe away, no matter how much energy a company puts into big-picture efforts.

== And if everything goes wrong...
- "Defenseur des droits"
- Laws again discrimination

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 (ex: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018877783[LOI n° 2008-496 du 27 mai 2008])
I hope you won't have to use it, but if everything goes wrong, we have laws against discrimination. In France, we also have a legislation called the "Defenseur des droits". 
--

== Do not fear to talk about it
[NOTE.speaker]
--
The more we will talk about these issues, the more chance we have to change things. If we all act as if it didn't exist, nothing will ever be done against discriminations.

== The goal is not to have a perfect diverse team but a team with enough diversity 

== Diversity attracts diversity
The problem becomes exponentially easier to solve once you’ve begun to solve it ^^

== We work with others + we care about our job = we should care about others

== Thanks !
